## Packages

We recommend using Rstudio and downloading the following packages:

* `knitr`
* `distill`

If you are interested in publishing a post follow these steps:

1) Install R and Rstudio and the packages (Just copy the uncommented code to you R console and execute it)


`#install.packages("knitr","distill")`
`library(knitr,distill)## loading the packages `



2) Create a project in Rstudio from the github repository for the blog: https://github.com/hamilton-institute/hamilton-institute.github.io

3) Then execute the following command to create you blog post:


`create_post("Insert the title of you post here")`

4) You can use all the functionalities of R Markdown as shown here:

Good Writing!
