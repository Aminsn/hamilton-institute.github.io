We have been awarded SFI funding to generate computational tools to help Ireland predict the epidemiological (disease-related) and economic consequences during the path to recovery in the COVID-19 pandemic. Our project will focus on putting computational models for medium term forecasting in place that will enable the state to make evidence-based decisions about the impact of relaxing COVID-19 restrictions. We aim to help the public stay informed about the data being generated 

This goal of this website is to show posts and apps about our work. Where possible, all our code will be made available in our [GitHub](https://github.com/hamilton-institute) repositories. 


The team includes:

- Prof Andrew Parnell
- Prof Ken Duffy
- Prof Subhra Dey
- Prof Damien Woods
- Prof Paul Moynagh
- Prof David Malone
